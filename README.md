# CS Games 2023 - Information and Application Instructions

## What is CS Games?

CS Games is an annual 3-day competition hosted by a different school each year, and will be held at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC) in March 2023. During the day there are various competitions related to computer science (e.g. web dev, functional programming, artificial intelligence) and **at night they host parties/events**. When you're not participating in an event, there are **TONS of sponsor companies looking to recruit and hand out swag**. It's an amazing experience and **the biggest event that CSS is involved with**. You'll get to learn, explore the city, meet cool people and **possibly land yourself a sweet job**! CSS subsidizes the trip for all twenty students and will be covering some costs (most likely flights) to the event.

Every year, the UWindsor Computer Science Society **sponsors** several CS students to attend the event and represent the university. Typically, we send 2 teams of 10 students (this may be subject to change).  

We will probably be able to bring two teams, **the second team will be mainly first and second years so don't be discouraged from applying if you're in first or second year**!
