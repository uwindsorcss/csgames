# CS Games 2023 - Information and Application Instructions

## What is CS Games?

**The Computer Science Games are a collegiate competition that includes challenges from all aspects of computing - happening March 17-19, 2023**

The Games are a weekend long thrill ride with logic puzzles, difficult algorithms, intense video game competitions, social activities, and of course, programming. Organized by students from different university every year, the CS Games is open to all undergraduate students.

Every year, the UWindsor Computer Science Society **sponsors** several CS students to attend the event and represent the university. Typically, we send 2 teams of 10 students (this may be subject to change).  
We will probably be able to bring two teams, the second team will be mainly first and second years so don't be discouraged from applying if you're in first or second year!
